            <h1>Topic: UberChef</h1>

            <p>Everyone loves a good dinner party right?  It’s a nice easy way to mix in with your colleagues, friends and family.  
            It’s a way of improving existing relationships and reconnecting with those that you care about the most.  Our project 
            idea is an easy way to outsource it all. A chef to cook in your own home from a pre-set menu, bringing all ingredients 
            and cleaning up afterwards.  This means you can invite more people. This means less stress for you and a great time for 
            everyone.</p>
            
            <p>You could even make money from hosting your own party!    Not much, depending on the amount of people.  But I was thinking 
            maybe around $100 per head, minimum of six, person whose house it is gets a cashback if everything goes smoothly.  So, you 
            are getting a party and meal for free!</p> 
            
            <p>Win! Win! For everyone!</p>

            <p>Wait right there, I know what you are saying – it’s already available from many catering firms etc.  But I was just thinking 
            of making it far easier to host.  All the cash is on a separate platform like many other services leading to greater security. 
            Instead of just ordering off menu log. Etc you can have a fully qualified chef in your house cooking for you personally. Maybe 
            a choice of two mains, three desserts etc, all pre-ordered and paid for.</p> 
            
            <p>Like a dinner party Deliveroo dude. Weddings,conferences, birthday parties, new foods, new tastes, a few meals for the week cooked in 
            advance, learn how to make that chocolate cake from masterchef, the list is endless. The best thing is that it does not take much to get started.  
            One decent chef getting paid nicely.   Working from a simple menu in advance for a fixed number of people can allow for partial pre-preparation.  
            All of this could be done separately under guidance from the chef.  It could go as far as including cooking demonstrations or classes 
            beforehand at an extra cost.</p> 

            <h1>Motivation</h1>

            <p>This is most definitely not an original idea.  Catering companies have been doing this for years.  My mother-in-law had her wedding in her 
            new house (rather a large house) with full catering and wedding service all in the one place for around 50 people.  Generally, when catering 
            is involved you choose from a choice of menus, let them know the date, location and amount of people and then get billed for that amount.  Weddings 
            are generally fixed months in advance.</p> 
            
            <p>I want to try and shift the focus to making this sort of thing more regular.  Imagine if all the members of your family pay say around $10 a week.  
            This is of course around $500 a year.  My starting price per person is expected to start around $100 (depending on the amount of people).  You could set 
            up a rotating roster of who’s house it will be at which time.  Set it for individual birthdays with different chefs.  Save it up for when you wish to partake 
            fine dining.  People could check off whether they will/will not attend.  We could set up a system where everyone votes on a day, time and menu.</p>

            <h1>Landscape</h1>

            <p>
                There are millions of ways to get food.  But the market is so large that you do not need a large slice to do well.  
                Fast food (now able to be easily delivered) is available everywhere.  Restaurants have encouraged takeaway through menulog and Ubereats.  
                Catered food for weddings and functions is at the other end.  New ways of delivering products are constantly being developed.  
            </p>
           
            <p>
                Many chefs have their own website and run their own business from there.  There are also other “hire a chef” websites worldwide, and also 
                others like airtasker which are not specifically food, are used to organise events.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Delivered food has become normal now.  Pizza, mc d’s, kfc, menulog, ubereats, Deliveroo etc.But these are missing the human connection.  
                You may see the delivery driver at the door but that’s it.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                I would like to see more food cooked at home.  Some people never cook at home and would struggle to feed a family gathering.  One way our 
                site could be different is to run it as a weekly sub as described in the motivation section above.  It could be a regular thing for a birthday.  
                You could organise the same meal with family once every two months and not worry about anything.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One advantage of this business is that it can be started small with little capital.  Chefs could keep their regular job and work casually now 
                and then from this platform.  They can stick to their local area.
