            <h1>Group processes and Communications</h1>

            <p>We held a web meeting for Assignment 3 twice a week during the period. Mainly we used Discord for chats and general matters such 
            as scheduling, questions, etc. and Microsoft teams for web meetings. As all the team members responded timely, we did not have any 
            communication issues, and managed to meet the submission due date.</p>
            
            <p>We allocated tasks according to our strengths and preferences such as website developments, research, interviews and writing. 
            Basically we go with the same methodology for Assignment 2 as for the 3. However, as we had difficulty with time management for Assignment 2, 
            we have started Assignment 3 earlier and set more detailed due dates for each of the tasks. As such, we managed to secure plenty 
            of time to review and discuss the assignment to improve the quality.</p>

            <p>Even though a few of our team members could not progress as fast as others due to work and other reasons, we managed to get
            the job done. Having group mates that are willing to communicate and work on the assignment is something that we are grateful
            for because it is not always the case with group work, which many tend to have bad experiences with.</p>
