            <h3 class="header">Interest in IT	:</h3>
            <p>In IT, I am very much interested in machine learning, security, and block chain technology. 
                I am fascinated by these subjects because it is very new, but it is also gaining more and 
                more importance in current era. My knowledge in these subjects are limited, but I have a strong 
                will to learn and understand these concepts, especially machine learning.</p>

            <p>My first interaction with a computer was when I was around 7 years old, my father taught me how 
                to use Microsoft word, he also introduced me to internet later on. What he showed me might be considered 
                as trivial today, he simply wrote a word in google image and then images related to the word would appear. 
                I was completely mind blown how the machine could understand to find images of objects based on its name, 
                of course I was oblivious about how it functioned. For someone that does not know how IT works, it is 
                almost magical.</p>

            <h3 class="header">Why I chose RMIT :</h3>
            <p>I chose to study in RMIT because it offers an online course that is way more accessible in many ways. 
                It gives more people the opportunity to get higher education by providing it online; especially in the 
                situation that the world is currently in. Another positive on RMIT’s online course is that yes, students can 
                follow the course on their own pace (made possible with recorded webinar and tutorials), but it also holds live 
                sessions. This is very interesting because although online courses can be convenient, it can also let the student 
                feel lonely due to almost non-existent level of engagement between the university and the student, as well as between 
                fellow students. Live sessions help to maintain a certain level of engagement so that students feel to be a part of a 
                live community. Live sessions are something that I appreciate deeply.</p>

            <h3 class="header">What I expect learning in my studies : </h3>
            <p>In my studies with RMIT, I expect to learn and understand the principles of IT such as programming, web development, 
                software development, system administration, databases management, algorithms, and various other subjects that I have 
                yet to discover.</p>

            </p>

            <h3>My description of the job :</h3>
            <p>This job advertisement is to be a systems engineer, specialized in naval combat system programs. There are many 
                programs that is linked to this job across Australian naval programs. More specifically, I am very much interested 
                in the Cyber security related field which is part of being a system engineer. Which is why I chose this job to be my 
                ideal job as it offers an opportunity that I am keen to dive into.</p>

            <h3>Skills required	:</h3>
            <p>The employer (SAAB Australia) is looking for people with a set of skills such as:
            <ul>-	System design</ul>
            <ul>-	Weapons engineering</ul>
            <ul>-	Cybersecurity engineering</ul>
            <ul>-	Model-based system engineering</ul>
            <ul>-	Electromagnetic environmental effects engineering</ul>
            <ul>-	Experience in mining</ul>
            <ul>-	Experience in oil and gas</ul>
            <ul>-	Experience in resources</ul>
            For now, I may not have any of the skills required for the job. That is why I am studying IT, so that one day I may have 
            the necessary skills and knowledge for jobs in the IT field.
            </p>

            <h3>Skills I possess</h3>
            <p>Although I currently do not possess all skills that are required, especially in cyber security where I am yet to be 
                initiated. I do have some basics in IT; these includes:

            <ul>-	Familiarity with Linux OS.</ul>
            <ul>-	Linux server management.</ul>
            <ul>-	Windows server management.</ul>
            <ul>-	Basic understanding of simple algorithms.</ul>
            <ul>-	Object oriented programming using Python and C.</ul>
            <ul>-	File handling using Python and C.</ul>
            </p>

            <h3>My plan :</h3>
            <p>Firstly, I plan to obtain my bachelor’s degree with RMIT in Information Technology. From there, with knowledge and 
                skills I obtained I may either start working to gain first-hand experience in a cybersecurity sector. Or I may also 
                apply for a master’s degree in cybersecurity and then start working after I obtain my master’s degree. There are many 
                pathways in IT, and I find that RMIT’s IT bachelor’s degree might open many doors and present opportunities for students 
                wishing to engage in the vast IT world.</p>

            <h2 class="header">Online Tests Results</h2>

            <h3>Myers-Briggs test:</h3>
            <p>Test link: <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test"> https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test </a> </p>
            <p>After taking the Myers-Briggs test, I got the following result: INTP-T Logician.</p>

            <!--PHOTO GOES HERE-->
            <img src="Test_pic_01.png" alt="Cool picture did not load :(" width="550" />

            <p>Key points of my personality according to the test are:</p>

            <p>Key points of my personality according to the test are:
            <ul>-	Introverted: Prefers solitary activities and get exhausted by social interaction.</ul>
            <ul>-	Intuitive: Intuitive individuals are very imaginative, open-minded and curious.</ul>
            <ul>-	Thinking: Thinking individuals focus on objectivity and rationality, prioritizing logic over emotions.</ul>
            <ul>-	Prospecting: Prospecting individuals are very good at improvising and spotting opportunities.</ul>
            <ul>-	Turbulent: Likely to experience a wide range of emotions and to be success-driven, perfectionistic and eager to improve.</ul></p>


            <p>They do have points that I mostly agree upon such as introverted and intuitive. However, some others I have difficulties relating 
                to such as brain driven decision making. I tend to be rational of course, but I believe that I am more emotional than how the result 
                make it seem.<br>
                But again, it is an online test (not a more precise personal test) so safe to say that it is pretty good for what it is.
            </p>

            <h3>Online Learning Style test result:</h3>
            <p>Test link: <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml</a></p>
            <p>After taking an online test aimed to find one's best learning style, here is the result:

            <ul>Auditory: 10%</ul>
            <ul>Visual: 55%</ul>
            <ul>Tactile: 35%</ul>

            According to the test, I am mostly a visual learner. As I have thought about it previously, I can say that I very much agree with the result. 
            I found that learning something visually is really helpful for me as I retain pictures more than text or audio.</p>

            <h3>The big 5 personality Test</h3>
            <p>Test link: <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test">https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test</a></p>


            <p>The test would give a rating based on 5 aspects abbreviated OCEAN: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. 
                Here is the result of my test:</p>

            <ul>O -> 73%</ul>
            <ul>C -> 54%</ul>
            <ul>E -> 27%</ul>
            <ul>A -> 67%</ul>
            <ul>N -> 73%</ul>

            <p>To summarize briefly, according to this test my Openness score is very high which means that I tend to be 
                more creative and imaginative than other that have taken the test. Similarly, to Myers-Briggs test, I am 
                more reserved/less extroverted than most people which means I have to put effort to maintain a good 
                communication with others, which is very important especially in a group.
            </p>

            <h3 class="header">What do the results of these tests mean to me?</h3>
            <p>For the most part, these tests seem to be confirming my initial assumption about how I work/study. 
                For example, the result of the online learning test indicates that I am first and foremost a visual learner. 
                This is something that I have put thought into before and I came to the same conclusion. Visual cues 
                tremendously help me to retain new information and it is hard for me to learn new concepts when there is a 
                lack of memorable visuals. I tend to attach information to an image, so that when I see the image, I can find 
                information that is related to it.</p>

            <p>However, it is apparent that I am rather a reserved person. Thus, communicating would need some effort for me. 
                Of course, I will do my best to maintain a good communication and relationship with my groupmates.</p>

            <h3 class="header">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
            </h3>
            <p>The test result indicated that I tend to be more introverted than extroverted (57% introverted), it is true 
                that in high school I tend to be reserved. But as I grow up, I feel that I am becoming more extroverted. 
                I do not have issues to communicate in a group, in fact in multiple occasions I had to take control and lead 
                the group. In conclusion, despite how the test stated that I am rather reserved, I believe I would have no 
                issue when it comes to communication.</p>

            <h3 class="header">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
            <p>It is very important to have a group that is balanced where all team members can work together to cover 
                everything needed. People have different personalities and expertise, it is a good idea to pick people 
                that are not a carbon copy of our own personality. Having diverse group members is beneficial as it keeps 
                it balanced; people have different ideas and when combined and handled properly, the best of everyone can 
                be applied for the good of the team and the product they work towards.</p>

            <h2 class="header">Project idea: EastSafe App</h2>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Very briefly, EatSafe is a food barcode scanner application. Until now, people rely on the ingredients section 
                on food packaging to figure out whether the food is suitable for them or not. However, it may be frustrating to 
                figure out exactly what is contained in the food based on the ingredients list and allergy warnings. EatSafe will 
                help consumer identifying whether a food item is suitable for them in a matter of seconds, simply scan the barcode 
                and it will display crucial information about the item. EatSafe is planned to be available on iOS & Android devices.</p>

            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>The market that this service proposes is very broad and can benefit a large group of potential consumers, almost 
                universally in fact. In Australia alone, it is estimated that 800.000 people are diagnosed with food allergy, and even more 
                are likely to be undiagnosed (Allergy & Anaphylaxis Australia 2021). With this number in mind, having an app for everyone that 
                can tell them whether they may eat food safely is very important. Furthermore, this may increase awareness of people who were 
                previously not concerned by food allergy. Awareness in matters such as food allergy is crucial in order to avoid unnecessary danger 
                and decrease food allergy related issues.</p>

            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>Due to its purpose, this service needs to be available primarily on mobile devices. EatSafe would be available on most (if not all) mobile 
                operating systems. Users would use their smartphone camera to scan barcode on food items, then the app will display necessary information. </p>

            <h3></h3>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Account creation</h3>
            <p>Firstly, users are asked to create an account, which would require an email or other social media account. Most other information 
                for the account creation is optional such as name, age, gender, allergy, diet, etc. Which means that they are free to provide such 
                information or not.</p>

            <p>Users may also use the app without an account (as a guest). However, they may need to re-enter their information such as allergy and 
                diet more than once. The guest profile would be stored locally on their devices. However, the creation of an account is highly encouraged 
                to mainly facilitate the user should any additional information need to be added/ accessed elsewhere.</p>

            <h3>Main screen</h3>
            <p>The main interface of this app would be the camera/ barcode scanner. This is the screen that would be shown to the user for quick and easy 
                use of the app. Other menus are accessible through various icons on the side or bottom of the screen.</p>

            <p>Once a barcode is scanned, this app would retrieve the food item that the code refers to and retrieve all necessary information 
                related to it such as: ingredients, traces of other ingredients, allergens, suitable diets, etc. Once all information obtained, 
                it will compare it to the diet profile of the user and show the result on the result screen.</p>

            <h3>Result Screen</h3>
            <p>The result screen needs to be simple, pleasing to the eye, and easy to understand. First and foremost, the user needs to know if 
                they should or not avoid the product. The app would display one of the following: Suitable, Risky, Avoid, or Unknown. Suitable 
                means that the product is in line with the user’s diet, risky means that there is possibility of ingredient traces of products 
                that is not in line with the user’s diet and avoid would mean that the product contains substance that would be an issue for the 
                user. The aim of EatSafe is to not use the “Unknown” result at all, however it is better than providing false information which 
                in this case is potentially dangerous.</p>

            <p>In addition, underneath the previous information, the app would also show common /dangerous allergens that is contained in the food. 
                This is regardless of the user’s profile. The aim of this section if to increase awareness of food allergy.</p>

            <p>And lastly, there is “More Info” button at the bottom should the user wish to know more about the product. All of this content must 
                fit in the screen with no scrolling required (when possible).</p>

            <h3>Scan History</h3>
            <p>The history will save everything scanned by the user for quick access. Every entry in the history would have a time and date in case 
                the user needs to backtrack or review scanned items.</p>

            <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
            <p>Hardware wise, EatSafe is rather simple as it is aimed at smartphone users which means it only requires a smartphone to function.
            For the development however, it would require a computer with the following specifications (approximatively):
            <ul>-	Windows OS</ul>
            <ul>-	Intel i7 processor (or equivalent)</ul>
            <ul>-	8 TB of local memory</ul>
            <ul>-	32 GB of RAM</ul>
            </p>

            <p>To develop the iOS version of the app, a different setup is preferrable with the following specifications:
            <ul>-	MacOS</ul>
            <ul>-	M1 Chip</ul>
            <ul>-	32 GB of RAM</ul>
            <ul>-	8 TB local memory</ul>
            </p>

            <p>In terms of software, the following is required:
            <ul>-	App-developing software</ul>
            <ul>-	Android or iOS</ul>
            <ul>-	Git/GitHub</ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Skills Required</h3>
            <p>Various skills are required in the completion of a project of this scale. Most apparent is the application development skill and 
                food allergy specialist. Various other experts regarding different diets also need to be highly involved in the making of this 
                application. Lastly, commercialization expert is also needed to successfully promote the app when finished.
                Most skills needed in this project are relatively easy to find, however it might be difficult to determine how many diets would be 
                covered by the app. A suggestion would be to start with a set amount of diet on launch and expand from there if need be.</p>

            <h3>Potential Drawbacks</h3>
            <p>Of course, there are potential drawbacks in the development of the app. The following includes a few of them:
            <ul>-	Application is poorly optimized: Loading time for each scan would be increased reducing the likeliness of users re using the app.</ul>

            <ul>-	Database is incomplete: Many food items won’t be identified because it is not in the database.</ul>

            <ul>-	Internet connection dependant: So far, the app requires constant internet connection.</ul>

            <ul>-	User’s diet is not (or not yet) implemented in the app: Not all existing diets would be implemented in the app upon launch.</ul>

            <ul>-	Compatibility issues: There are many android versions which may spawn compatibility issues.</ul>

            <ul>-	Item not identified/ app cannot find item in the database.</ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The original problem was that it is sometimes difficult to find what substances are contained in a food item, some substance may pose a 
                threat or issue to many people which is why this is an issue. This problem is solved by having an app that could scan and immediately 
                tell the user if it is suitable for them or if they better avoid it.</p>

            <p>Should this project be completed, launched, and operating as initially intended, the effect of this application has the potential to do 
                many things. Not only it will conveniently help people find safe food or avoid dangerous food at any given time, but it may also increase 
                awareness regarding food related issues and even reduce the number of allergy related disease.</p>
