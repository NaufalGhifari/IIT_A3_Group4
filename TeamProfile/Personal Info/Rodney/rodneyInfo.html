<h3 class="header">Interest in IT	:</h3>
    <p>My interest in I.T stems from when i was a young kid playing games on my Computer, i would always find it fun to mess around with the games code and cause funny things to happen (Later on i found out this was called Modding). I went onto building my own PC and even making my own basic games from scratch in game engines like RPG Maker and GameMaker Studio. What made me decide to take on I.T as a profession happend last year during lockdown, when a a friend of mine in England who built his own drone and showed it to me via a video call. he let me take control of the drone from my house here in Australia and flew it around a park in England. It was one of the coolest things to fly a real drone around a real place on the otherside of the world in realtime. I decided from then on that working with I.T was what i really wanted to do</p>

    <h3 class="header">Ideal Job</h3>
   
    <p>An ideal job for me would be to work in the Maritime Industry specialising in I.T, Modern boats are very reliant on I.T for Navigation, Communication, Organisation, Automation. In the defence force most combat systems are digital, such as Radar, missile guidance systems, sonar, encryption and many others.</p>
    <p>My Ideal job within the maritime industry would be working with Cyber Security, such as with the Navy or in Port Security. Cyber Crime is a huge threat to the maritime industry. A cyber attack against a port which disables port opperations could cause an economy to collapse, or even cause a world recession like we saw in 2008. The job linked above is for a I.T administrator for Ports and Airports in Tasmania. The job involves managing the I.T systems for 11 ports and 1 airport in Tasmania, such a job would involve leading a team of I.T professionals to ensure that systems run smoothly and help quickly fix problems such as equipment failure, software failure, or cyber threats. The job would also involve working with law enforcement to ensure that criminal activities are prevented. Such a job appeals to me because i would be exposed to advanced technologies surrounding the maritime industry which i could use to help me with my own Sailing, as maintaining the electronics onboard a yacht can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, experience and the knowledge to DIY would make sailing far more affordable long term.</p>
    <p>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have: I have basic knowledge 
    of Python and SQL, deep finance knowledge and strong written and verbal communication skills.</p>
    <p>This job would require formal qualifications in I.T, such as a Bachelors or Masters in I.T and many years practical experience. Managing the I.T systems for ports and airports would make me responsible for border security and the safety of airplane passengers, such a job obviously requires high standards of knowledge in I.T and the many daily problems that are faced by airports and ports. While i may have many years experience toying around with Technology and programming it hardly qualifies as suitable experience for managing a port, and nor do i have the formal qualifications required to do so either. I am studying this I.T course as a step forward towards solving these problems. I hope to gain some more practical experience working as a Pen Tester part time in the next few years, i am studying a Cert IV in Cyber Security at RMIT aswel as this I.T course, i hope that the Cert IV can lead to some part time employment that will give me practical on-the-job I.T experience.</p>
