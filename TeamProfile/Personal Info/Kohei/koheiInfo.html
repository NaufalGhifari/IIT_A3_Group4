            <h3 class="header">Interest in IT	:</h3>
            
            <p>My interest in IT started when I first used Google search engine to search for an artist.
            I got lots of detailed information as a result. If I had manually searched for it, it would have taken 
            much more time. Since then, I have been trying to fully utilise IT to improve my productivity.</p>
            
            <p>I have an Accounting/Finance background and a diploma in IT, working as an M&A adviser in Singapore.
            When it comes to open innovation/capital alliances between traditional companies and startups, 
            it is necessary to understand the technologies of startups such as fintech, digital health, blockchain, etc. 
            Without essential IT knowledge, I had difficulty to fully grasp their business model and strategies. 
            As such, I have decided to take this course to improve my IT knowledge. Bachelor of Information Technology 
            fits my purpose, as it provides comprehensive subjects of information technology. Prior to this course, 
            I have completed a diploma in Web Technologies in Singapore. During my studies, I would like to especially 
            learn advanced programming, cloud computing, security and software engineering.</p>
