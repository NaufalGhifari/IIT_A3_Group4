			<h1>Career Plans</h1>

			<p>
            	Since we did not receive any suggestions on our ideal jobs, we do not change them. Three of the team members would like to have cyber security jobs, 
				and one of the team members wishes to secure a data scientist job.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For the most part, we plan to graduate from RMIT as bachelors of IT and use the gained skills and knowledge to either change career or start a new career 
				in the IT industry. As mentioned above, some of us are looking into working in cyber security and/or data scientist related fields.
