			<h1>Career Plans: No changes (Naufal, Koehi, and Rodney)</h1>

			<p>
            	Since we did not receive any suggestions on our ideal jobs, we do not change them. Three of the team members would like to have cyber security jobs, 
				and one of the team members wishes to secure a data scientist job.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For the most part, we plan to graduate from RMIT as bachelors of IT and use the gained skills and knowledge to either change career or start a new career 
				in the IT industry. As mentioned above, some of us are looking into working in cyber security and/or data scientist related fields.
			</p>

            <h1>Career plans changes: Data Analytics (Nathan)</h1>

            <p>
                One area I am interested in is Augmented Analytics, although when researching it it seems to be often described as simply Data Science.  One thing that is 
                certain with the vast internet of things is that the amount of data is constantly expanding.   I am particularly interested in the stock market and how 
                algorithms trade with other algorithms to make money.  One course I was also looking at before choosing IIT was financial planning.  I like to dabble a little 
                in the stock market but trade for the long term.  I would like to learn how to apply algorithms and try automated investing and day trading. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I like how it can also involve a bit of programming and see the language R is mentioned often.  There are a multitude of Introductory lessons online to learn R 
                which is a popular language designed for data science.  The next course after this will be the Introduction to Programming which will help me in choosing how to 
                pursue this.

                Team Leader, Data and Analytics Job in Sydney - SEEK
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is an absolutely awesome job working for the government at the top of the financial chain - The Reserve Bank.   Being that I am already employed for the local
                government I understand that it will be a tough job, working hard, non-stop, short lunches and long days with management looking over your shoulder.  Stop laughing, 
                it's true.  
            </p>

            <p>
                There is no better place to earn money than at the place that prints it.  
            </p>

            <p>
                The Reserve Bank analyses swathes of data from the economy (particularly the financial sector)  in order to figure out where to put (or restrict) the federal governments 
                influence.  The Reserve Banks influence on the economy has been likened to steering an oil tanker.  It can take a long time for the effects to be noticed. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Reserve Bank is responsible for keeping the financial system honest and looking out for problems before they happen.  This looks like it is a new department also and 
                would be fantastic to start on the ground floor setting up systems to automatically interpret the data looking for anomalies.
