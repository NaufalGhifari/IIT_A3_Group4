            <h2>Market Research</h2>
            <p>
            Firstly we have conducted market research if the application fits the market demand and to define the problem that the app solves. In Australia, 
            there are a few food delivery apps such as Uber Eats, Menulog, Deliveroo and Doordash and they oligopolize the market. Wes Lambert, CEO of the 
            Restaurant & Catering Association, states that before the coronavirus, Uber Eats had 60% of the delivery market, Deliveroo and Menulog had 30%, 
            and self-delivery apps had 10%, but the number of businesses organizing their own delivery and takeaway was growing (Waters 2020). As they charge 
            nearly 30% of commission to merchants, it is difficult for merchants to make profits from food delivery and lots of restaurants have been closed, 
            although the demands for food delivery have been increasing due to the covid crisis. Also, from customers’ perspective, as restaurants raise 
            prices to recover losses caused by commission by food delivery platformers. The purpose of Uberchef is to solve the inefficiency in the market. 
            The app charges just 5% commission for one placement to chefs and customers, so customers can hire chefs at reasonable prices. Our main targets are 
            middle end restaurant/chefs and middle-class families, because according to (ref), middle-class families account for the majority in Australia and 
            they wish to dine out the most once the pandemic settles. On the other side, middle-end restaurants have difficulty to continue business due to the 
            restriction of their operation after the covid crisis. However, customers are not likely to let in chefs inside their house at this moment unless 
            the pandemic situation fully settles in the country. We are planning to officially launch the app early next year. We will spend 2 weeks at this stage.
            </p>

            <h2>Budgeting</h2>
            <p>
            Our development team includes one project manager, one designer, five software engineers and two testers. All of them are secured within our company, 
            so we do not outsource any of the development process. As we will go with Android as a platform of the app, we will assign engineers having knowledge 
            and experience of Kotlin. Based on man-days of our internal resources, estimated as follows: the initial development costs of A$250,000, annual 
            marketing costs of A$100,000 and annual maintenance costs of A$50,000. We will be able to recover our investment within 2 years from the official 
            launch in February 2022. Depending on merchants and customers demands and feedback, we will consider improving or additionally developing the app. 
            We are planning to enter Singapore and Malaysia in 2023 and Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand 2024. We are planning to secure funds of A$1 million from 
            a venture capitalist to execute this app development project. This stage will last 2 weeks.
            </p>
 
            <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
            <p>
            User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are closely linked to user satisfaction. As such, the success of the app depends on sophisticated UI/UX 
            design. Wireframes and an entity-relationship model of the app are described by Naufal. There are two types of users in the app, merchants and customers. 
            He designs all the pages for them using a wireframe development tool. Based on his wireframes, our software engineers will develop each of the pages of 
            the app. We record users’ data in our database. He designs a relational database using an entity-relationship model. Its tables include chef, customer, 
            order, and menu, all of which are linked using primary and foregin keys. Its actual database will be developed by software engineers with MySQL.
            This stage will take 3 weeks.
            </p>

            <h2>Frontend and backend development</h2>
            <p>
            Mobile app development has two types, the front-end/user side of the app and the other focusing on the back-end/server side of the app.
            The frontend development will take 3 weeks and the backend will also last 3 weeks. As it is not possible to concurrently conduct the 2 types of the development. 
            In total, this stage will last 6 weeks.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p>
            After the development stage, testing will be conducted to detect any errors and/or bugs. They will be fixed by the software engineers. This stage is important 
            to provide smooth and comfortable user experience and satisfaction. Testing includes functional testing, unit testing, integration testing, and device testing.
            This stage will extend 2 weeks.
            </p>

            <h2>Application Support</h2>
            <p>After the official launch of the app, referring to users’ feedback, the app will be continuously fixed, because all errors may not be able to be detected in the testing stage.</p>
            
            <h2>Deployment</h2>
            <p>
            Next, the app will be deployed in Apple's App Store. Google play store optimization is necessary to provide our target users with the app.
            
            <br> We will complete this stage in 1 week.
            </p>
