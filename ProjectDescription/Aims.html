            Our aim is to have an easy to setup business model which can easily expand to various cities. Initially we would need a small amount of investor capital.  
			This would mainly be used to hire one chef permanently to help with running parties, advertising the business both with chefs and customers and integrating 
			efficiently between the investors, site developers, partiers, chefs and suppliers.  <br>
			Our business would largely deal with the chefs as individual contractors, with each individually dealing with clients to showcase their skills and range of cooking talents.
			Working in a restaurant a chef can be sidelined into producing what the restaurant wants served.  This can be as simple as what is most profitable.  
			Here they can showcase their best and be at their most presentable.  <br>
			
			How-ever we cannot just randomly pick employees and by already having a skilled chef already doing this we can ease the transition from back of kitchen to front of house. 
			Also, our full-time chef can assist with any guidance the new chef may need.
