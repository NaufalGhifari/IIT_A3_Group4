            <h1>Technologies and Tools</h1>

            <h2>1. Servers</h2>
            <p>
                Servers with at least multiple petabytes of storage, a minimum of 3TB of ECC memory and the appropriate processing capabilities to 
                handle the amounts of information required. Rodney has had prior experience with high end servers with his work in the maritime industry. 
                Such as CAD computers for ship design, Weather prediction computers and AIS systems.
            </p>
            
            <h2>2. App Design Development</h2>
            <p>
                UI Design software such as Mockflow. This tool requires a fee, which is $120 dollars per team member working on it (So $480 in our case) 
                per year. Naufal has experience with this from his prior work on this project and previous projects he has worked on. However, considering 
                the early stage of development and the cost of the service, he decided to go with Figma, which does everything we need for this project such as 
                wireframing and later on prototyping.
            </p>
            
            <h2>3. Finance Software</h2>
            <p>
                Finance software. Such as Freshbooks which will cost 600 a year for our company. Kohei has had extensive experience with this sort of tool 
                with his strong financing background.
