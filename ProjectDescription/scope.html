                This project aims to develop an app to make hiring a private chef easier. There are many features an app 
                like this must have on a basic level. Such as separate account types for clients and chefs and different user 
                interfaces for each type. Such as the chef having the means to update his culinary resume, update specialty 
                dishes and provide a level of advertisement for their services. While the client’s user interface should include 
                search features for different types of cuisines, search different locations for future events such as a planned 
                holiday and have access to the reviews of chefs featured on the app.
            </p>

            <p>
                One feature that the app should include for paperwork purposes is the means for clients to input allergies, intolerances 
                and preferences into the app itself. This will allow chefs to view vital information on food preparation choices all in one 
                place. For example, someone may not like Garlic, however many Italian dishes are prepared with white wine mixed with garlic. 
                This information will allow the chef to know if the client has an allergy, where the use of garlic is strictly prohibited or 
                if they simply have a preference against the flavor. Many foods can be used in the preparation of a dish that has a distinct 
                and unique flavor (An example is Chocolate, you may dislike milk but love chocolate, but you may also have an allergy to milk 
                and therefor an allergy to chocolate)
            </p>

            <p>
                Another feature that would be good to include would be a means for the Chef and Client to agree on a “Start” and “Finish” time 
                for payment purposes. A simple feature to accommodate this would be to have a bar code for the Chef to scan on the client’s phone 
                and when the night is over, they simply scan a different bar code on the client’s phone which allows the app to track hours. Chefs 
                also require time to prepare meal ideas beforehand, so chefs would also be able to add a ‘flat fee’ on top of there hours for the 
                planning and time required to source the ingredients for the meals, such as $50. Many professional chefs may require higher fees 
                however as the hospitality industry is very competitive and standards are high, so more time may very well be required and thus a higher fee.
            </p>

            <p>
                The app gets its inspirations from apps such as Uber Eats and MenuLog which provide food delivery services from take away and sit 
                in restaurants through independent delivery drivers. One feature that these apps have in common is GPS tracking of the driver so you 
                know when your food is arriving, this feature would be incredibly difficult and expensive to implement into our app. We would require 
                servers to constantly monitor, process and send customers GPS information for potentially hundreds of chefs every second. While this may 
                add a sense of security of comfort for customers knowing that there chef is arriving on time, it may be more economical for our app to simply 
                trust chefs and customers, for example it is highly unlikely that a customer will wait till the end of the planned evening to complain that there 
                chef did not show up/provide them with meals as opposed to earlier in the evening when the chef was supposed to show up. While there is always the 
                exception to the rule, we believe it would be more economical to deal with the exceptions on a case by case, as opposed to implementing resource intensive 
                features to provide levels of comfort for these occurrences. Reviews will also contribute to client trust of chef’s reliability and trustworthiness.
