            <p>
                We will require a large variety of technologies and software to help us develop this app, we also 
                need to do a large variety of tests to ensure that the app works correctly. Most importantly of 
                all we would need to hire ethical hackers to test our security of peoples payment and private information. 
                This is to ensure that before we release the app to the public there is a degree of tested security for peoples 
                information. Penetration tests are important for any online service company, and we should have them do regularly 
                for security purposes even after the app is launched.
                <br><br>

                We should also do closed testing of the apps user interface (UI), asking a select few members of the public if they 
                like the apps UI and to provide feedback. This will allow us to refine the UI for ease of use and customer satisfaction, 
                many apps have failed simply due to people disliking the UI. Another test we should do before the app is released is to 
                test the service in high demand, we can do this by programming AI (both chefs/clients) to use the app by browsing it, talking 
                to chefs, creating bookings etc. We would ensure that the AI are logged in the same way that a user would be. This will allow us 
                to test the reliability and performance of our app and servers under high load, similar to what we hope to see when the app is launched.
