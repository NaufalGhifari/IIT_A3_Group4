            <h1>Risks</h1>

            <p>Risks are somethings that are not avoidable, the best thing to do is to take them into consideration and prepare in case the unwanted occurs. 
            Several risks that are proper to our project have been identified, these do not include broad and common risks such as hardware breakdowns or 
            personal related issues. Risks to our project include but not limited to:</p> 

            <h2>1. Not using the correct programming language.</h2>

            <p>Choosing the correct language for the app before starting to develop the application is arguably the most important choice. 
            Using the wrong language for a project will only spawn unnecessary limitations and complications and ultimately undermine the 
            end product. Furthermore, if the issues become too hard to deal with, it is possible by then that re-starting the project from 
            scratch would be unavoidable, this is surely something that is not desirable.</p> 

            <h2>2. Android compatibility issues as the development is focused on iOS.</h2>

            <p>The application is planned to be released on iOS and android smartphones. However, the development of the app is currently focused 
            on iOS platforms because it is deemed to be more standardised and stable, hopefully this may help the development process. However, 
            it is possible that the android version of the app will create many complications other than general compatibility issues. For example, 
            there are only a few different screen sizes that run iOS. This is not the case with android which has many different sized screens as 
            well as issues with android skins used by various manufacturers.</p> 

            <h2>3. User data privacy and security.</h2>

            <p>Data security is something to be taken seriously as failure to provide adequate security for user data that are used by the service may 
            create serious repercussions. For example, when using inadequate encryption when storing the data, it may be fetched and decrypted by a 
            non legitimate party in which case, usersâ€™ identity would be severely compromised.</p>
