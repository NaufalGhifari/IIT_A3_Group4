            <h1>Why use Uberchef?</h1>

            <p>Everyone loves a good dinner party right?  It’s a nice easy way to mix in with your colleagues, friends and family.  
            It’s a way of improving existing relationships and reconnecting with those that you care about the most.  Our project 
            idea is an easy way to outsource it all. A chef to cook in your own home from a pre-set menu, bringing all ingredients 
            and cleaning up afterwards.  This means you can invite more people. This means less stress for you and a great time for 
            everyone.</p>
            
            <p>You could even make money from hosting your own party!    Not much, depending on the amount of people.  But I was thinking 
            maybe around $100 per head, minimum of six, person whose house it is gets a cashback if everything goes smoothly.  So, you 
            are getting a party and meal for free!</p> 
            
            <p>Win! Win! For everyone!</p>

            <p>Wait right there, I know what you are saying – it’s already available from many catering firms etc.  But I was just thinking 
            of making it far easier to host.  All the cash is on a separate platform like many other services leading to greater security. 
            Instead of just ordering off menu log. Etc you can have a fully qualified chef in your house cooking for you personally. Maybe 
            a choice of two mains, three desserts etc, all pre-ordered and paid for.</p> 
            
            <p>Like a dinner party Deliveroo dude. Weddings,conferences, birthday parties, new foods, new tastes, a few meals for the week cooked in 
            advance, learn how to make that chocolate cake from masterchef, the list is endless. The best thing is that it does not take much to get started.  
            One decent chef getting paid nicely.   Working from a simple menu in advance for a fixed number of people can allow for partial pre-preparation.  
            All of this could be done separately under guidance from the chef.  It could go as far as including cooking demonstrations or classes 
            beforehand at an extra cost.</p>
